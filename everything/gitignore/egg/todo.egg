- ALWAYS REMEMBER
  - THIS IS BUILT FOR WINDOWS. We aim for Windows compatibility over other systems. Maybe later we can make Linux systems, and
    MAYBE brave the monster that is Apple.
  
- MAIN TODO
  - Clean up RELEASES
  - Find out how the tag system works
  - Consider using the remote tunnel for VScode, run at home?
  - Make new updating system working, implement it
    - transfer over user specific data (colors.json, high_scores, etc?)
  - if no shortcut during installer, tell them what file to run
  - add dev feature using old installer system in order to get the most recent files (also disclose the risks with this)
    
  - Update rhythm game
    - Update score handling
      - have a health handler that will make you lose if you miss too many notes
      - add high score.json, display that on end screen ----------------------------------------------
      - update high score if higher is reached -------------------------------------------------------
    - Add pausing?
    - add volume controls
    - divider lines upwards lining up with letters (between letter and zone) - NOTE: HAS TO FADE
    - choose better colors for end-screen

  - use github LFS - large file storage
