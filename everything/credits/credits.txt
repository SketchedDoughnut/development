I AM PROUD TO SAY THERE IS A MINIMAL TO NONE AMOUNT OF CHATGPT CODE IN ANY OF MY PROGRAMS!
Everything here was developed by me (the creator, Sketched Doughnut), EXCEPT:

- GitHubFolderDownloader (unused) located in archive/old_update/fiesta.py and fiesta.exe
    - https://github.com/fbunaren/GitHubFolderDownloader
    - NOTE: Link can also be located in ./sources.txt

- Conways Game of Life: Co-developed by me and i1aw
    - https://github.com/i1aw

- Songs used in the rhythm game:
    - "Boggle" by Mega Mango
    - "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" by Tears for Fears
    - "Whats The Rush?" by Jesse Woods
    - "Stayed Gone" from Hazbin Hotel by Amir Talai, Joel Perez, Sam Haft, Andrew Underberg, Christian Borle

- Pyinstaller: Has been fundamental in making fiesta.exe, fiesta-modern.exe
    - https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/



And finally, thanks to my doggo for cuddles :3
