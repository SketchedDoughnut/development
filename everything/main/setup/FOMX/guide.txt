If your curious, FOMX stands for:
- File 
- Overwriting
- Management
- X-press
Credits to my ~ windy ~ friend for inspiring this name :3

IMPORTANT
- FILE DETAILS AND FILE PATHS MUST BE IN THE SAME ORDER, DUE TO HOW IT IS HANDLED
- JSON IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED IN FOMX RELEASE
- THE FOLLOWING FILES CAN NOT BE INFLUENCED BY FOMX:
    - obviously, fomx.py
        - copy.py and download.py can not be accessed if there is no pycache, 
          they can be (THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING THIS IN A 
          PUBLIC RELEASE)
    - and audio files (.mp3, .wav, etc)
    - any folders
    - fiesta.exe
    - full-redo.py
    - full-redo.exe
    - IF NOT THESE, THEN THE FILE IS AVAILABLE FOR READ/WRITE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how data is formatted:
{
    "description": "This is an example message about a small release message! This is in the body of the release.",
    "version": "0/20",
    "file_details": [["file.py", "normal"], ["file.exe", "binary"], ["data.json", "json"]],
    "file_paths": ["everything/blah/blah/blah", "everything/blah"]
}

Explanation:
- description:
    - is used to display in console IF THE USER WANTS TO.
- version:
    - how many files are affected in the patch, up to 20. When it reaches 20 / it has been two months, the patches get reset and an update is put out.
- file_details:
    - is used for the file names, and what type of read/write mode they need (read binary and write binary, normal read and write, etc).
- file_paths:
    - is used to get the file path BESIDES the file itself. So file_details[0] needs to be added onto this.
