- MAIN TODO
  - make this stupid updating functionality work please
    - add the update functionality to installer (god help me)


    - FIND OUT HOW TO UNZIP FILES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    - OH MY GOD I HAVE HAD ENLIGHTENMENT
      - OK OK so when the installer installs the files, have it change data.json for
      the INSTALLED installer to "shortcut: True, "update": False", "bounds": None
      - change main shortcut into installer 
        - when "shortcut": True, don't run installer as normal and redirect to starter.py (branches from there)

      - WHEN AN UPDATE IS NEEDED, DO THE FOLLOWING:
        - read an included file (update_info.txt?), see if the text "EMO" is in it
          - if EMO:
            - print('A complete re-install is urgently needed. Please re-install the installer.')

        - if a normal game_data re-install:
          - update.py does to data.json of setup: "shortcut": False, "update": True, "bounds": "game_data"
          - exits, direct them to run the normal shortcut 
          - installer is ran, creates a backup of game_data if wanted
          - installer deletes and re-installs game_data
          - changes data.json: "shortcut": True, "update": False, "bounds": None

        if a full re-install (top and below):
          - update.py does to data.json of setup: "shortcut": False, "update": True, "bounds": "full"
          - exits, direct them to run the normal shortcut 
          - installer is ran, creates a backup of all files (top and below) if wanted
          - installer deletes and re-installs top
          - changes data.json: "shortcut": True, "update": False, "bounds": None
