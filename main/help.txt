Welcome to the file to help you setting up your installer.

What inputs should look like (test case):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOWNLOADING
    - python version: 3.9
    - repo url: https://github.com/BillyBob/carnival

SHORTCUT
    - shortcut_path: shortcut name
    - shortcut_target: main/data/start.exe
    - shortcut_wDir: main/
    - shortcut_icon: main/data/start.exe 

Section notes:
    - when shortcut is setup, the path must be relative to where the installation is made.
        - installation path is "C:\main"
        - the path you input for shortcut_target is from "C:/main" to where the file you want to execute is.
        - lets say the folder "data" is installed via the installer in "C:/main". 
        - shortcut should route inside that install path "C:/main" to your file.
        - say your executable is in a folder named "data" that gets installed inside of main.
            - example you would input:
                - data/file.exe
    - shortcut_icon and shortcut_target are the same
    - repo_url can be used with repositories under organizations (supposedly)
