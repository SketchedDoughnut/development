OK SO I CHALLENGED VINCENT TO MAKE A RYTHM GAME AND NEED TO MAKE IT BEFORE END OF WEEKEND TUESDAY
THE START DAY IS 4/5/24, FINISH BY FOLLOWING TUSSDAY

Goal:
    -So, here is what I intend to do. I am going to draw a rectangle on the bottom, visible.
    I am going to divide the top if the screen into an even amount, likely 8ths. 
    Squares will be drawn into one of these 8 positions. When they reach the bottom rectangle,
    you have to press the appropriate key.
        - keys can be (normal home typing pos): 
            - left: A, S, D, F
            - right: J, K, L, :
    Once you do, the cube will change color indicating it has been activated. 
    Once the cube is off of the screen, if it is activated, it will add to your score.
    It will also increase a streak. If it is not activated, it will reset your streak 
    and your score will go down.
    Music will be played in the background and somehow synced with these notes.
            
    TODO:
    - NEED TO FIND OUT HOW TO MAP MUSIC INTO GAME, PREFERABLY FINAL PRODUCT IS A LIST
    - FIND OUT HOW TO PRELOAD AUDIO
