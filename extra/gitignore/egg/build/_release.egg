The purpose of this file is to note down what to do for releasing updates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- transfer files over from FOMX
- transfer files to SDA-SRC, and SDA with the affected files
    - make sure URLs and anything like that are kept the same
- run any propogators (elevator or crash handler)
- compile files LAST
- push code to Github
- create a release of the new code (for SDA-src, refer to "THE-OVERBEARING-NOTES.EGG" for how to format releases)
    - do note, it will take a little for Github to update with the newest files
