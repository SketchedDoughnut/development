- MAKE SURE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY

- make sure file directories are adapted for intent (codespace/VSCode, or normal pc)
    - lookup:
        - NOTE: NEWER DEVELOPED PROGRAMS USE A WORKING DIRECTORY SYSTEM AND DO NOT NEED THIS SYSTEM
        - # - for codespace
        - # for run

- clear any specific files of their directories (ie. delete.json)
- reset data.json in setup/
- clean up pyinstaller.exe before release-based commit

- make sure all .exe are compiled and organized right
